# springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb

The goal of this project is to explore [`Kafka`](https://kafka.apache.org), [`Debezium`](https://debezium.io/), and [`ksqlDB`](https://www.confluent.io/product/ksqldb/). The project includes: `research-service`, which performs CRUD operations on records in [`MySQL`](https://www.mysql.com); `Source Connectors` that monitor changes in MySQL and push related messages to Kafka; `Sink Connectors` and `kafka-research-consumer` that listen to Kafka messages and update documents in [`Elasticsearch`](https://www.elastic.co); and `ksqlDB-Server`, which listens to Kafka topics, performs joins, and pushes new messages to Kafka.

## Proof-of-Concepts & Articles

On [ivangfr.github.io](https://ivangfr.github.io), I have compiled my Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) and articles. You can easily search for the technology you are interested in by using the filter. Who knows, perhaps I have already implemented a PoC or written an article about what you are looking for.

## Applications

- ### research-service

  Monolithic [`Spring Boot`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/index.html) application that exposes a REST API to manage `Institutes`, `Articles`, `Researchers` and `Reviews`. The data is saved in `MySQL`.
  
  ![research-service-swagger](documentation/research-service-swagger.jpeg)

- ### kafka-research-consumer

  `Spring Boot` application that listens messages from the topic `reviews_researchers_institutes_articles` (that is one of `ksqlDB` outputs) and save the payload of those messages (i.e, reviews with detailed information) in `Elasticsearch`.

## Prerequisites

- [`Java 21`](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21) or higher;
- A containerization tool (e.g., [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com), [`Podman`](https://podman.io), etc.)

## Start Environment

- Open a terminal and, inside the `springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb` root folder, run the following command
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```
  > **Note**: During the first run, Docker images for `mysql` and `kafka-connect` will be built with the names `springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb_mysql` and `springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb_kafka-connect`, respectively. To rebuild these images, run:
  > ```bash
  > docker compose build
  > ```

- Wait for all Docker containers to be up and running. To check it, run
  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```
  
## Create Kafka Topics

In order to have topics in `Kafka` with more than `1` partition, we must create them manually and not wait for the connectors to create for us. So, for it

- In a terminal, make sure you are in the `springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb` root folder

- Run the script below
  ```bash
  ./create-kafka-topics.sh
  ```

  It will create the topics `mysql.researchdb.institutes`, `mysql.researchdb.researchers`, `mysql.researchdb.articles` and `mysql.researchdb.reviews` with `5` partitions.

## Create connectors (3/4)

- In a terminal, make sure you are in the `springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb` root folder

- Run the following `curl` commands to create one `Debezium` and two `Elasticsearch-Sink` connectors in `kafka-connect`
  ```bash
  curl -i -X POST localhost:8083/connectors -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @connectors/debezium-mysql-source-researchdb.json
  curl -i -X POST localhost:8083/connectors -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @connectors/elasticsearch-sink-institutes.json
  curl -i -X POST localhost:8083/connectors -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @connectors/elasticsearch-sink-articles.json
  ```

- You can check the state of the connectors and their tasks on `Kafka Connect UI` (http://localhost:8086) or calling `kafka-connect` endpoint
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8083/connectors/debezium-mysql-source-researchdb/status
  curl localhost:8083/connectors/elasticsearch-sink-institutes/status
  curl localhost:8083/connectors/elasticsearch-sink-articles/status
  ```

- The state of the connectors and their tasks must be `RUNNING`. If there is any problem, you can check `kafka-connect` container logs.
  ```bash
  docker logs kafka-connect
  ```

## Run research-service

- Open a new terminal and navigate to the `springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb` root folder

- Run the command below to start the application
  ```bash
  ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects research-service -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9080"
  ```
  It will create some articles, institutes and researchers. If you don't want it, just set to `false` the properties `load-samples.articles.enabled`, `load-samples.institutes.enabled` and `load-samples.researchers.enabled` in `application.yml`.

- The Swagger link is http://localhost:9080/swagger-ui.html

- **Important**: create at least one `review` so that `mysql.researchdb.reviews-key` and `mysql.researchdb.reviews-value` are created in `Schema Registry`. Below there is a sample request to create a review.
  ```bash
  curl -i -X POST localhost:9080/api/reviews \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{ \"researcherId\": 1, \"articleId\": 1, \"comment\": \"Ln 56: replace the 'a' by 'an'\"}"
  ```

## Run ksqlDB-cli

- Open a new terminal and, inside the `springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb` root folder, run the `docker` command below to start `ksqlDB-cli`
  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm --name ksqldb-cli \
    --network springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb_default \
    -v $PWD/docker/ksql/researchers-institutes.ksql:/tmp/researchers-institutes.ksql \
    -v $PWD/docker/ksql/reviews-researchers-institutes-articles.ksql:/tmp/reviews-researchers-institutes-articles.ksql \
    confluentinc/cp-ksqldb-cli:7.8.0 http://ksqldb-server:8088
  ```

- On `ksqlDB-cli` command line, run the following commands

  - Set `auto.offset.reset` value
    ```bash
    SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';
    ```
  
  - Run the following script. It will create `researchers_institutes` topic
    ```bash
    RUN SCRIPT '/tmp/researchers-institutes.ksql';
    ```
  
  - Check whether the topic was created 
    ```bash
    DESCRIBE "researchers_institutes";
    SELECT * FROM "researchers_institutes" EMIT CHANGES LIMIT 5;
    ```
  
  - Run the script below. It will create `reviews_researchers_institutes_articles` topic
    ```bash
    RUN SCRIPT '/tmp/reviews-researchers-institutes-articles.ksql';
    ```
  
  - Check whether the topic was created
    ```bash
    DESCRIBE "reviews_researchers_institutes_articles";
    SELECT * FROM "reviews_researchers_institutes_articles" EMIT CHANGES LIMIT 1;
    ```

## Create connectors (4/4)

- In a terminal, make sure you are in the `springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb` root folder

- Run the `curl` command below to create `elasticsearch-sink-researchers` connector in `kafka-connect`
  ```bash
  curl -i -X POST localhost:8083/connectors -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @connectors/elasticsearch-sink-researchers.json
  ```

- You can check the state of the connector and its task on `Kafka Connect UI` (http://localhost:8086) or calling `kafka-connect` endpoint
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8083/connectors/elasticsearch-sink-researchers/status
  ```

## Run kafka-research-consumer

- Open a new terminal and navigate to the `springboot-kafka-connect-debezium-ksqldb` root folder

- Run the command below to start the application
  ```bash
  ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects kafka-research-consumer -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9081"
  ```
  > The command below generates the Java class `ReviewMessage` from Avro file present in `src/main/resources/avro`
  > ```bash
  > ./mvnw generate-sources --projects kafka-research-consumer
  > ```

- This service runs on port `9081`. The `health` endpoint is http://localhost:9081/actuator/health

- \[Optional\] We can start another `kafka-research-consumer` instance by opening another terminal and running
  ```bash
  ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects kafka-research-consumer -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9082"
  ```

## Testing

- Go to the terminal where `ksql-cli` is running
  
- On `ksql-cli` command line, run the following query
  ```bash
  SELECT * FROM "reviews_researchers_institutes_articles" EMIT CHANGES;
  ```

- In another terminal, call the `research-service` simulation endpoint
  ```bash
  curl -X POST localhost:9080/api/simulation/reviews \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"total\": 100, \"sleep\": 100}"
  ```

- The GIF below shows it. `research-service` is running in the upper left terminal; `kafka-research-consumer` is running in the upper right terminal; the middle terminal is used to submit the POST request to `research-service`. The lower terminal is where `ksql-cli` is running. 

  ![execution-example](documentation/execution-example.gif)

- You can also query `Elasticsearch`
  ```bash
  curl "localhost:9200/reviews/_search?pretty"
  ```
